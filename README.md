# spell_checker

In this project, I built a spell checker that handles both real-word (that are learned from the given corpus) and non-words (does not exist in the corpus) errors given a sentential context. To do so, I built a language model, and learned error distribution tables from lists of common errors. Then, I combined them to a context sensitive noisy channel model.
